# About me

I recently graduated from MalmÃ¶ University, specializing in systems development, which included backend development, data integration, and API embedding. My final capstone project was a full stack web application to assist a scout organization in managing carpools and overseeing communication in the organization. The application includes features like real-time chat, role-based authentication, and a notification system which alerts users on important changes or events.

In my bachelorâ€™s thesis, I took a deep dive into discrete mathematics and computational geomtry and developed a standalone application aimed at aiding researchers in the study of plane almost perfect matchings. The applicationâ€™s main function is to generate configurations and allow researchers to inspect them, thus enhancing the interactive oversight.

I worked as a teacher for over a decade prior to entering tech. The role helped sharpen my communication skills, taught me to simplify intricate subjects, and helped me deliver quality work within tight deadlines. I am currently looking for work in backend development and full stack development. You can reach out to me on LinkedIn if you feel I could add value to your company.
