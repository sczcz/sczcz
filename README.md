# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Anders Dahlheim

I recently graduated from MalmÃ¶ University as a systems developer, focusing my studies on backend development, data modeling and API integration. For my final capstone, I built a full-stack web app that helps a scout organization manage carpools and communication. It includes features such as real-time chat, role-based authentication, and a notification system that alerts users on schedule changes.

In my bachelorâ€™s thesis, I created a visualization tool for exploring matching configurations and their associated flip graphs. This standalone application is designed to assist researchers studying the reconfiguration of plane almost perfect matchings, allowing them to generate and inspect configurations interactively.

Prior to entering tech, I spent more than a decade as a teacher. This background refined my communication abilities, taught me to break down complex topics, and allowed me to maintain quality work under tight deadlines. I am now seeking opportunities in backend or full-stack development, eager to craft resilient, impactful software that meets usersâ€™ needs.
