# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Anders Dahlheim

I'm a newly graduated systems developer from MalmÃ¶ University with an interest in backend development, data modeling, and API integration. For my capstone project, I developed a full-stack web application for coordinating carpools and communication within a scout organization, featuring real-time chat, role-based authentication, and a notification system.

As part of my bachelorâ€™s thesis, I developed a tool for visualizing matching configurations and flip graphs. This is a standalone artifact aimed at supporting the study of reconfiguration of plane almost perfect matchings.

Before transitioning into tech, I worked as a teacher for over 10 years, an experience that helped me build strong communication skills, structure complex work, and deliver during periods of high workload. I'm now actively looking for roles in backend or full-stack development where I can contribute to meaningful and well-crafted software systems.
